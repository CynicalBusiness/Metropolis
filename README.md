\- Installation: To install, start by downloading the file from the BukkitDev or Mayateck website. This will provide you with a fully packaged Java Archive (JAR) file. Place this file into your plugins folder. Next, access your server and restart it. (Reloading will also work, but is *STRONGLY* not recommended.)

TL-DR: Put JAR in the plugins folder and restart.
